As for what kind of purchases are/will be available:\
- #GOLD#Cosmetics#LAST#: in addition to the existing racial cosmetics & item shimmers available in the game you can get new packs of purely cosmetic items & skins to look even more dapper!\
- #GOLD#Pay2DIE#LAST#: Tired of your character? End it with style!\
- #GOLD#Vault space#LAST#: For those that donated they can turn all those \"useless\" donations into even more online vault slots.\
- #GOLD#Community events#LAST#: A few online events are automatically and randomly triggered by the server. With those options you can force one of them to trigger; bonus point they trigger for the whole server so everybody online benefits from them each time!\
